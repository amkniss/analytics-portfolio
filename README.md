- Identified $1M+ in revenue optimization opportunities
- Created interactive dashboards for stakeholder presentations

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** - Data analysis and processing
- **Chart.js** - Interactive data visualizations
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Responsive dashboard design
- **JavaScript** - Dynamic filtering and interactivity

## ✨ Key Features

### Interactive Visualizations
- 📊 **4 Dynamic Charts** - Real-time data visualization with Chart.js
- 🔍 **Searchable Tables** - Filter customers instantly
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- 💾 **Export Functionality** - Download data as CSV

### Customer Segmentation
- **Mega Customers (>$100K)** - VIP tier identification
- **High-Value ($20K-$100K)** - Strategic account management
- **Medium-Value ($5K-$20K)** - Growth opportunities
- **Growing ($500-$5K)** - Retention targets

### Analytics Capabilities
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) calculation
- Purchase frequency analysis
- Revenue distribution modeling
- Cohort segmentation

## 📈 Business Impact

This analysis identified:
- **83.3%** of revenue from just 5 mega customers (Pareto principle)
- **$1.9M** in at-risk revenue from offline customers
- **20 high-frequency buyers** perfect for automation
- **139x ROI** potential from recommended initiatives

## 🔒 Data Privacy

*Note: All data in this demo is sanitized for portfolio purposes:*
- Company names replaced with fictional entities
- Email addresses partially masked
- Contact information anonymized
- Real calculation methodologies preserved

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Collection** - Aggregated from multiple sources (CRM, e-commerce platform)
2. **Processing** - Python scripts clean, merge, and calculate metrics
3. **Analysis** - Segmentation algorithms identify customer tiers
4. **Visualization** - Interactive Chart.js dashboards present findings
5. **Insights** - Automated reports highlight opportunities

## 📊 Dashboard Components

### Top Section - Key Metrics
- Total customers
- Total revenue
- Average LTV
- Repeat purchase rate

### Charts
1. **Top 20 Customers** - Bar chart showing revenue leaders
2. **Top 20 Products** - Horizontal bar of best-sellers
3. **Revenue Distribution** - Pie chart by customer segment
4. **Customer Count** - Bar chart showing segment sizes

### Interactive Table
- Searchable customer list
- Priority scoring
- Exportable data

## 🎓 Methodologies

### LTV Calculation
```
LTV = Average Order Value × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan
```

### Customer Segmentation
Based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis:
- **R**ecency: Days since last purchase
- **F**requency: Number of orders
- **M**onetary: Total revenue contribution

### Priority Scoring
Weighted algorithm considering:
- Revenue (40%)
- Order frequency (30%)
- LTV potential (30%)

## 💡 Use Cases

This type of analysis enables:
- **Marketing** - Target high-LTV customers for retention campaigns
- **Sales** - Prioritize outreach to mega customers
- **Product** - Stock fast-moving items adequately
- **Strategy** - Identify revenue concentration risks
